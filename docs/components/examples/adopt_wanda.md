### 🎲 Quiz — instant feedback
**Q:** What makes something an *object*?

- [ ] Just the data it stores.
- [x] State **and** behaviour, together.
- [ ] A file you `import`.

### 🎓 ACM SIGCSE TS 2026 — Peer Review
💬 _A rare fusion of low-code technology and computing pedagogy — innovative and grounded._  
💬 _The progression from visual exploration to executable models supports authentic learning while staying accessible for diverse learners._  
💬 A deeply thoughtful and forward-thinking contribution that bridges professional software practices with approachable computing education.

### 👨‍🎓 UWM Learner Feedback
💬 _Working on this assignment has shown me how visual and interactive elements make learning and coding clearer. Seeing how pets (Lucky and Wanda) react in real time made methods, states, and relationships more concrete. It also improved my ability to think from a user's perspective and design engaging, user-friendly features. Overall, it enhanced my coding skills and problem-solving approach._

## 2️⃣ Adopt Wanda 🐕 + 🐠 = 🏰
🐠 Challenge: Adopt Wanda, a fish. 
🐕 Yet only the brave dog Lucky can do communicate with.   
🎯 __Actualy, it's all about problem solving with object states and behavior.__

## 🥎 Play with pets

```yaml
lucky:
  colour: Golden
  weight_kg: 30
  top_speed_kmh: 45
  adopted: true
wanda:
  colour: Orange
  weight_kg: 0.03
  top_speed_kmh: 6
  adopted: false
```
{: .scene3d #challenge_scene height="420" goal="adopt_wanda" }

## 🕵️ The finish photo {#finish}

## Yet, Does this reflect the learning?
However, the gap is that, whatever the learning environment is, only the final photo 
is not reliable enough to confirm learrnerss’ skill match CLO, including in the AI era 
where a copy/paste gives a shortcut, jeopardising both academic cunduct and learner’s 
later biger problems.

If you're an educator you can ask yourself
**Q:** A learner submits the "finish photo" — Wanda adopted, the quiz passed. 
From that result alone, can you tell whether it was their own reasoning or an AI-assisted paste?

- [x] No — the finish looks identical either way. You'd need the *process*.

  > That's the gap: same outcome, very different journeys.

- [ ] Yes — reaching the goal proves understanding.

  > Not on its own — a paste reaches the same goal with no understanding.

- [ ] Yes — AI answers are always wrong.

  > They're often right — which is exactly why the result can't tell you.

- [ ] Only if you watched them the whole time.

  > You can't watch everyone — which is why the *trace* matters.
