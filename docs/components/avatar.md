# 🧑‍🏫 Avatar

A speaking **overlay character** — Prof. LC — that narrates a page: it **walks**
from element to element, **spotlights** what it's describing, and **speaks**
each line. The voice is the browser's speech synthesis, a studio audio file, or
a recorded video face. It's the platform's *guide engine*: tutorials, guided
tours — and the player behind the [🎬 demo](/components/demo)'s **▶ Replay**.

**This page is the tutorial** — press ▶ Play and let it show you.

```yaml
voice: en-US
script:
  - "Hello! I'm Prof. Zam — I narrate pages, line by line."
  - at: avatar_playground
    say: "I walk to the element I'm describing, and spotlight it."
  - at: avatar_go
    say: "That button started me — it stops me too. Click me to do the same."
  - "Scripts can also play studio audio, or a recorded video of a real face."
```

dog: Lucky
treats: 3

## 🛠️ How to make one

A YAML fence holds the config + script; a trigger link plays/stops it:

````markdown
```yaml
voice: en-US
script:
  - "Hello! Let's explore this page together."
  - at: some_widget
    say: "This grid is editable — click a cell."
```
{: .avatar #guide }

[▶ Play](#)
{: .avatar_trigger target="guide" label-stop="⏹ Stop" }
````

## 📜 Script lines

A line is a plain string (the character wanders) or an object:

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `at:` | The **id** of the component (or heading) to walk to — scroll there, park beside it, **spotlight** it |
| `say:` | The line — spoken, and shown in the speech bubble |
| `audio:` | URL of a pre-recorded audio file — plays instead of TTS; the mouth follows the real waveform |
| `video:` | `true` / URL — play the recorded character clip **with sound** for this line (real face, real voice) |
| `cues:` | Inside one recorded take: `[{ t: seconds, at:, say:, slide: next\|prev\|start\|exit }]` — fire as the clip crosses each time |
| `input:` | Drive a Rive character's state machine — `"bark"` fires that trigger, `{ run: true, speed: 7 }` sets inputs |
| `pause:` | Seconds to hold after the line (default 0.5) |
| `step:` | `true` forces a stop at this line; `false` chains on even in step mode |

## 🔧 Knobs

In the YAML (or as attributes on the block):

| Knob | What it does |
|---|---|
| `voice` | BCP-47 tag (`fr-FR`) — the best-quality matching browser voice is picked. Default: the page's language (**en-US**). **`off`** = silent: the bubble shows each line, dwells, moves on |
| `rate` / `pitch` | TTS tuning (defaults 0.95 / 1.05) |
| `path` | Where untargeted lines park: `left` · `center` · `right` · `wander` |
| `autoplay` | `true` starts on page load |
| `step` | `true` = step-by-step: each click plays **one** line and waits (▶ Start → Next → ↺ Replay) |
| `size` | Pixel size of the character bubble (attribute, default 140) |
| `lottie` | A Lottie JSON URL — or `{ url, idle: [from,to], talk: [from,to] }` frame segments |
| `rive` | A `.riv` URL or `{ url, stateMachine }` — inputs named like *talk*/*mouth* are auto-wired to the narration |
| `video` | A recorded clip URL (or `[webm-alpha, mp4]` fallbacks) — the character *is* the video |
| `transparent` | `true` + an alpha WebM: the face floats free, no round crop |
| `elevenlabs` | An ElevenLabs voice id (or `{ voice, model }`) — playback auto-finds each line's pre-generated studio file and falls back to TTS; see 🎙️ below |

Without `lottie`/`rive`/`video`, the built-in **Prof. LC** face is used — round
professor glasses, expressive brows (they lift while speaking), a bow tie; it
blinks, breathes, its eyes *and head* turn toward the spotlighted element, and
its mouth follows the voice. Fully procedural — new text never needs new assets.

## 🎬 Studio — record the narrated walk

[🎥 Studio](#)`{: .avatar_studio target="guide" }` opens the
[screen recorder](/components/recorder), plays the avatar over the page (or the
[slides](/components/slides) deck), stops when the script ends, and offers the
YouTube upload — a narrated video of the page, produced by the page itself.

A `pick` trigger (`{: .avatar_trigger pick target="guide" }`) plays a **local**
video file as the character — in-memory only, never uploaded or committed.

## 🎙️ Studio voices from text — no recording (ElevenLabs)

Browser TTS is the zero-setup default; for **studio quality that still needs no
recording**, generate the audio **from the script text**, straight from the
page. Put a generate button next to any avatar (there's a live one at the top
of this page):

````markdown
[🎙️ Generate voices](#)
{: .avatar_voices target="guide" }
````

Click it. It asks (**first time only** — both are remembered on this device,
like your ✏️ editor connection, and reused silently after that;
**Shift-click** the button whenever you want to change them): your
**ElevenLabs voice id** and your **API key**. Then, per script line, it:

1. **generates** the missing audio (ElevenLabs, called from *your* browser),
2. lets you **hear it immediately**,
3. **commits** the mp3s *and the page's voice manifest* to the repo via the
   ✏️ editor's PAT — and the manifest is how playback **wires itself**: no
   fence config, no `audio:` keys, nothing to edit. Lines without a generated
   file simply fall back to TTS.

- **Change a line → click again**: files are content-addressed (hash of
  voice + text), so only changed lines are regenerated and billed; everything
  unchanged is cached forever — and stale audio can never play against new
  text.
- **Your own voice**: clone it once on elevenlabs.io (included in paid plans) —
  every new text then speaks as *you*, never recorded again.
- **Visitors are never involved**: they get plain static mp3 files — no API,
  no key, none of your credits.
- Optional: pin the voice in content with `elevenlabs: <voice_id>` in the
  fence (playback then computes filenames even without the manifest).
- Prefer the terminal (bulk pages, CI)? `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_… node
  packages/gen-audio.mjs docs/your-page.md --voice <voice_id>` — identical
  file naming and manifest, interchangeable with the button.

## 🤝 With the demo — ▶ Replay

The [🎬 demo](/components/demo) records a learner's actions; its **▶ Replay**
compiles that trace into an avatar script and hands it to this engine:
Prof. LC re-walks the learner's path, spotlights each
widget they touched, re-applies their edits live, and narrates. Same character,
two jobs: **guide** on the way in, **witness** on the way back.

## ⚠️ Good to know

- **Voices vary by device** — browser TTS quality differs; set `voice` to your
  page's language, use `voice: off` for silence, or record real audio/video for
  studio quality.
- **Autoplay needs sound permission** on some browsers — the trigger click is
  the reliable start.
- The spotlight is an amber outline on the `at:` element. Point `at:` any
  component's **id** — forms, quizzes, grids and headings all resolve, wherever
  the platform placed them.
