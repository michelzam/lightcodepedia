{% include example.md module="infost_350/lucky_wanda" %}


💬 _Working on this assignment has shown me how visual and interactive elements make learning and 
coding clearer. Seeing how pets (Lucky and Wanda) react in real time made methods, states, and relationships more 
concrete. It also improved my ability to think from a user’s perspective and design engaging, 
user-friendly features. Overall, it enhanced my coding skills and problem-solving approach._
